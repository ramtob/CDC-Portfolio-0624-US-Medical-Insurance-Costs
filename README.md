# US Medical Insurance Cost Portfolio Project

This is a portfolio (external) project from an early stage in Codecademy's Data Science path.
The project consists in reading a dataset file and computing a number of basic statistics, mainly averages, and relations between variables.
The project does not involve dataframes, statistical functions or data visualization, which were not taught at that stage in the course.  

Included files are a dataset (CSV) file and a Python notebook, which contains the code and the results.
